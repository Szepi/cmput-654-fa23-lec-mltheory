We consider probability distributions on the truth assignments, and restrict the attention to distributions that have the following properties: 1. The inputs come from a product distribution. 2. The output probability (of the root being assigned zero) is some fixed r such that 0{\textless}r{\textless}1. Among such distributions we investigate the maximizer of the minimum expected cost. We show that the maximizer is an independent identical distributions (IID). The result may appear to be straightforward but, the fact is that the proof requires new ideas. As keys to the proof, we show fundamental relationships between the following two quantities: 1. The probability of the root being assigned zero. 2. The minimum expected cost. Our result justifies a claim in the paper of Liu and Tanaka (2007) [3].},

A formula is first developed to measure the average number of terminal nodes examined by the algorithm in a uniform tree of degree n and depth d when ties are allowed among the bottom positions: specifically, all bottom values are assumed to be independent identically distributed random variables drawn from a discrete probability distribution. A worst case analysis over all possible probability distributions is then presented by considering the limiting case when the discrete probability distribution tends to a continuous probability distribution. The branching factor of the alpha-beta pruning algorithm is shown to grow with n as ?(n/lnn), therefore confirming a claim by Knuth and Moore that deep cut-offs only have a second order effect on the behavior of the algorithm.},

We next generalize SuzukiÐNiida's result on binary trees to the case of multi-branching trees. By means of this result and our optimal algorithm, we show that for any balanced multi-branching ANDÐOR tree, the optimal distributional complexity among all the independent distributions (ID) is (under an assumption that the probability of the root having value 0 is neither 0 nor 1) actually achieved by an independent and identical distribution (IID).},

	abstract = {We describe a novel parallel randomized search algorithm for two-player games. The algorithm is a randomized version of Korf and Chickering's best-first search. Randomization both fixes a defect in the original algorithm and introduces significant parallelism. An experimental evaluation demonstrates that the algorithm is efficient (in terms of the number of search-tree vertices that it visits) and highly parallel. On incremental random game trees the algorithm outperforms Alpha-Beta, and speeds up by up to a factor of 18 (using 35 processors). In comparison, Jamboree [ICCA J. 18 (1) (1995) 3Ð19] speeds up by only a factor of 6. The algorithm outperforms Alpha-Beta in the game of Othello. We have also evaluated the algorithm in a Chess-playing program using the board-evaluation code from an existing Alpha-Beta-based program (Crafty). On a single processor our program is slower than Crafty by about a factor of 7, but with multiple processors it outperforms it: with 64 processors our program is always faster, usually by a factor of 5, sometimes much more.},

	doi = {10.1109/SFCS.1986.44},
	abstract = {The Boolean Decision tree model is perhaps the simplest model that computes Boolean functions; it charges only for reading an input variable. We study the power of randomness (vs. both determinism and non-determinism) in this model, and prove separation results between the three complexity measures. These results are obtained via general and efficient methods for computing upper and lower bounds on the probabilistic complexity of evaluating Boolean formulae in which every variable appears exactly once (AND/OR tree with distinct leaves). These bounds are shown to be exactly tight for interesting families of such tree functions. We then apply our results to the complexity of evaluating game trees, which is a central problem in AI. These trees are similar to Boolean tree functions, except that input variables (leaves) may take values from a large set (of valuations to game positions) and the AND/OR nodes are replaced by MIN/MAX nodes. Here the cost is the number of positions (leaves) probed by the algorithm. The best known algorithm for this problem is the alpha-beta pruning method. As a deterministic algorithm, it will in the worst case have to examine all positions. Many papers studied the expected behavior of alpha-beta pruning (on uniform trees) under the unreasonable assumption that position values are drawn independently from some distribution. We analyze a randomized variant of alphabeta pruning, show that it is considerably faster than the deterministic one in worst case, and prove it optimal for uniform trees.},

It is shown, by the martingale method, that the standard deviation of the weaker ?-? search without deep cutoffs is of the same order as the expected number of leaves evaluated. A nearly optimal upper bound on the variance of the general ?-? search is obtained. A thorough treatment of the two-pass SCOUT algorithm is presented.
